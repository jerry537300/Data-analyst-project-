# Data Analyst Project

Hi! This is my personal data analyst project. I’m using this repository to learn, experiment, and document my progress in data analysis, from cleaning data all the way to building models and creating visualizations.

## What’s This About?

I started this project to dig into real-world datasets and try out different techniques and tools. My main goal is to get better at finding insights in data—whether it’s trends, predictions, or just cool visualizations.

**Tech I’m Using:**  
Mostly Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I rely a lot on Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and sometimes scikit-learn for machine learning experiments.

**Data Sources:**  
I’ll be using a mix of public datasets, some sample data, and maybe even a few custom ones I generate myself.

## How It’s Organized

Here’s how I’m organizing things so far:

```
data/        # Where I put raw and cleaned data files
notebooks/   # My Jupyter notebooks for analysis
src/         # Python scripts and helper functions
outputs/     # Any charts, reports, or saved models
README.md    # This file!
```

## Getting Started

Want to check it out or try running something?

   ```
2. Install the Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open a notebook from the `notebooks/` folder and start exploring!
